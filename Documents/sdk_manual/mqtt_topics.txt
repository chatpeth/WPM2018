####Topics between NodeMCU and Node-Red
###Create broker with cloud mqtt (Maximum 10 connections per one broker). Cloud mqtt is private mqtt broker
##NID = {1, 2, 3, ...}	#Node ID
<NID>		#configuration of client e.g. log interval, polling interval, enable/disable log

##Power in Watt, measure every polling_interval (See polling_interval topic)
<NID>_p0	#power phase A e.g. 1_p0
<NID>_p1	#power phase C
<NID>_p2	#power phase C

##Alarm
Alarm<NID>	#power up/down event

#Configurations
log_enable<NID>	#enable/disable data log on spreadsheet; Client(NodeMCU) will send data to Google spreadsheet if log_enable = 1. If log_enable = 0 client will discard data log
log_interval<NID>	#log interval; Client(NodeMCU) will measure PhaseA,B and C power and send to Google spreadsheet every log interval if log_enable = 1 (in millisecond)
polling_interval<NID> #Client will measure PhaseA,B and C power and publish to mqtt broker (in millisecond)

##Power calculation, The equation P = m*f + C , When P refer to Power(W), f is frequency on Hz
##Administrator can set these value on server(Node-Red) to publish the equation to Client(NodeMCU)
m<NID>	#m is slope of the equation
C	#Cross the f-axis is C

##Energy in kW hour
##Energy will calculate every 5 second with equation Et = (5/3600)*(p/1000)
<NID>_e	#total 3 phases energy
<NID>_p0_e	#energy phaseA
<NID>_p1_e	#energy phaseB
<NID>_p2_e	#energy phaseC

##Force restart client when no response longer than 5 minutes(default). In this way, The client can restart if still connect to the Internet
sw<NID>


####Topics between Node-Red and Windows form Applications
###Use test.mosquitto.org  (Unlimited connections, be careful with topic unity). test.mosquitto.org is public broker
##NID can be any; In demo version will be {fff1, fff2, fff3, ..., ff10} Please note that NID must unity in one mqtt broker
<NID>/p/a	#power phase A e.g. 1/p/a
<NID>/p/b
<NID>/p/c
<NID>/p/3phase	#total 3 phase power
<NID>/pavg/3phase	#average 3 phase power
<NID>/pavg/min	#average power in one minute
<NID>/peak/a	#peak power in 15 minute of phaseA
<NID>/peak/b
<NID>/peak/c
<NID>/e/3phase	#total 3 phases energy
<NID>/e/a	#energy phaseA
<NID>/e/b
<NID>/e/c
<NID>/peak/3phase	#peak power in 15 minutes (Detect from total 3 phases power)


####Firebase data structure
###Use Firebase as database of the system
##The structure can import to Firebase from eepdb-5d383-export.jsonv file
##NID = {1,2,3, ...}
<NID>/energy/p0	#energy which calculate from instantaneous power (Et = (5/3600)*(p/1000)) of phaseA
<NID>/energy/p1
<NID>/energy/p2
<NID>/energy/total	#total 3 phases energy
<NID>/energy/tp0	#energy phaseA
<NID>/energy/tp1
<NID>/energy/tp2
<NID>/power/p0	#power phaseA
<NID>/power/p1
<NID>/power/p2
<NID>/setting/log	#enable/disable log
<NID>/setting/log_interval
<NID>/setting/polling_interval
Peak/<NID>_PA	#peak power in 15 minute of phaseA
Peak/<NID>_PB
Peak/<NID>_PC
Peak/<NID>_Pavg	#average power every 5 second
pavg_per_hour/<NID>	#average power in one hour
pavg_per_min/<NID>	#average power in one minute
stat/<NID> #average power in one minute
stat/data1	#total power of zone 1 (Calculate from average power in each contain node in zone, e.g. Zone1 {node1, node2, node3}; data1 = sum(pavg/min)
stat/data2	#total power of zone 2
stat/data3
stat/data4
stat/data5
stat/pt/<NID>	#total 3 phases power
stat/z<NID>	#list of node in each zone

####Netpie feed
###Add peak power (Avery 15 minute) to netpie database (feed), this database can keep data 1 year, maximum update interval is 15 seconds
<NID>_PA	#power phaseA
<NID>_PB
<NID>_PC
